## Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

# Dataset Information
This task's goal is to detect hate speech in tweets. To keep things simple, we claim a tweet contains hate speech if it contains a racist or sexist emotion. So the objective is to distinguish between racist and sexist tweets.

Formally, your goal is to predict the labels on the test dataset given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist.

We give a tagged dataset of 31,962 tweets for training the models. The dataset is provided as a csv file, with each line containing a tweet id, its label, and the tweet.
